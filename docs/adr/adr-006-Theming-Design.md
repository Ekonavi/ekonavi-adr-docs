Managing multi-regional and multilingual sites

Google recommends using different URLs for each language version of a page rather than using cookies or browser settings to adjust the content language on the page.

URL structure options
Country-specific domain
example.de

Pros:

Clear geotargeting
Server location irrelevant
Easy separation of sites
Cons:

Expensive (can have limited availability)
Requires more infrastructure
Strict ccTLD requirements (sometimes)
Subdomains with gTLD
de.example.com

Pros:

Easy to set up
Can use Search Console geotargeting
Allows different server locations
Easy separation of sites
Cons:

Users might not recognize geotargeting from the URL alone (is "de" the language or country?)
Subdirectories with gTLD
example.com/de/

Pros:

Easy to set up
Can use Search Console geotargeting
Low maintenance (same host)
Cons:

Users might not recognize geotargeting from the URL alone
Single server location
Separation of sites harder
